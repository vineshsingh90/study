1. What is Angular?</summary>    
   Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework, developed and maintained by Google. It offers an easy and   powerful way of building front end web-based applications.
Angular integrates a range of features like declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, etc. that facilitates web application development.

2. Define the ng-content Directive?</summary>    
Conventional HTML elements have some content between the tags. For instance:
<p>Put your paragraph here</p>
Now consider the following example of having custom text between angular tags:
<app-work>This won’t work like HTML until you use ng-content Directive</app-work>
However, doing so won’t work the way it worked for HTML elements. In order to make it work just like the HTML example mentioned above, we need to use the ng-content Directive. Moreover, it is helpful in building reusable components.
